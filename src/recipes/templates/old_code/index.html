Other common grounds may include historical, political or cultural similarities.The obvious ones are self explanatory. This can be well observed in Asian and Central European countries, they tend to gravitate towards each other. This also confirms that our dataset is not corrupted and our calculations are correct. <br> <br><ins><strong>Uncommon observations:</strong></ins> <br>While most of the results make sense, there are some anomalies or they seem to be. The title indicates that something is wrong with Mexico. As mentioned before, calculations are correct so there must be something wrong with the data. But before we dig deeper into them lets explain some minor deviations or, at first glance, strange results: <br> <br><ins>MOROCCO:</ins> <br>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_cuisine" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> Moroccan cuisine is typically a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine. Which means that top 5 results should be from these areas. Spain is pretty high (7th) and Greece as well (6th). The abnormal parts are the top two results, Pakistan (makes some sense because of religion) and Bangladesh. Lebanon on 3rd place and Turkey on 5th make sense but India falls into the same basket as Pakistan and Bangladesh. This might be explained by the lack of data about Northern African cuisines. <br>Without doubt the results would have been different if we would have data about Algeria, Tunisia and other cuisines from that area. <br> <br><ins>RUSSIA:</ins> <br>Lack of data for Eastern Europe suggests the same problem as with Morocco and the sheer vastness of the country doesn't help but according to <a href="http://www.russian-plus.com/history-of-russian-cuisine-13889" target="_blank">this article</a> our data (strange as it looks, makes sense). The article says that 18th century was a new era in the development of Russian society. <a href="http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/the-romanov-dynasty/peter-i/" target="_blank">Peter I</a> not only transferred the capital to St. Petersburg closer to the Western Europe and changed the calendar, he changed many traditions. Russia was becoming more and more influenced by Western European cuisine, first German and then Dutch and French. The Russian aristocracy was hiring foreign chefs that totally replaced old lady cooks. If we observe our top results we get Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. One must also distinguish between Soviet and Russian cuisine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_cuisine" target="_blank">Soviet cuisine</a> extends Russian boundaries to all former Soviet republics and takes influences from their national cuisines. Most dishes were simplifications of French, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian cuisines. Caucasian cuisines, particularly Georgian cuisine, contributed as well. <br> <br><ins>INDONESIA:</ins> <br>Top three, according to our data, are Bangladesh, Pakistan and Philippines. The later can be easily explained by physical location but the first two come as a surprise. The two biggest islands in the archipelago are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra" target="_blank">Sumatra</a> and according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> Sumatran cuisine often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Colonial history explains the relatively high rankings of Portugal (13th), Spain (15th) and Netherlands (18th). <br> <br><ins>ISRAEL:</ins> <br>Mostly influenced by Jewish cuisine and incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. According to <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2008/07/01/about-israeli-food" target="_blank">SBS</a> the influences on Jewish food can be divided into two: that of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic. Ashkenazic refers to Jewish immigrants from Eastern and Western Europe. Sephardic refers to the Jewish people originating from the Middle Eastern countries. That would explain the top rankings of European countries. But according to the same article it has a strong Spanish and Portuguese influence. Well, our data shows Portugal on 12th place, Morocco on 14th and Spain at a very low 25th place. With the lack of data for most Middle Eastern countries we cannot confirm this but Turkey ranks pretty hight (8th) and Lebanon as well (16th). <br> <br><ins>ITALY:</ins> <br>Italian cuisine is mostly influenced by Mediterranean on or we could also say that Mediterranean is highly influenced by Italian. According to our data that seem to be true. Tops 6 cuisines are all from Mediterranean region but it comes as a surprise that Turkey ranked first. Well, two countries do have a lot of common history. Turkey, being a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" target="_blank">Roman</a> and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine empire</a>, had influence on Italian cuisine. <a href="https://jumpinweb.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/food-exchange-between-italy-turkey/" target="_blank">This post</a> suggests that Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences from Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman,Byzantine and Jewish. <br>The same article states that Italian and Turkish cuisine have many common ingredients but they vary in spices. Italian being more simplistic, using less spices, then that of Turkey. Common spices are basil, pepper, mint, and parsley. Also both cuisines use a lot of seafood and share a big passion for salads (olive oil, feta cheese, vinaigrette and chopped green vegetables with tomatoes). <br> <br><ins>SPAIN:</ins> <br>Our results suggest that Spain is highly similar to Turkish and Pakistani cuisine. This can be partially explained by the dominion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors">Moors</a> in Spain, which invaded Iberian peninsula in 711 AD. The Muslim connection is a plausible explanation even though the Moors were of Berber and Arab descent and the name is connected with, what is now, Morocco which ranked 4th in our calculations. Spain was a major player in the colonial age and in the age of exploration of the New World (Americas) so that could explain its connection to the Mexican cuisine, it would be interesting to see the similarities to other Latin-American countries (data is absent). <br>Portugal, its western neighbor ranked 5th, surprisingly low. Spain also incorporates a lot of Mediterranean dishes which connects it to Greece at 6th, Lebanon at 7th and Italy at 9th place. <br> <br><strong><h3>There are also some that, according to our data, seem to make little or no sense. These are:</h3></strong> <br> <br> <p id="explanation_intro"><ins>PHILIPPINES:</ins> <br>Out of top 5 only two make sense. Indonesia at 2nd place and China on 4th place. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_cuisine" target="_blank">Philippine cuisine</a> is in fact strongly connected to both Indonesia and China. This can be explained by geographical and cultural similarities. Well there is not much of those with China but the cuisines are proven to be similar. The confusing part is Bangladesh being the top ranked, Pakistan on third place and Turkey on fifth. Unfortunately we found no explanation in the literature to explain this uncommon similarity . <br> <br><ins>PORTUGAL:</ins> <br>According to the article published in <a href="http://portuguesefood.about.com/od/PortHistory/a/The-Diverse-Influences-That-Created-Traditional-Portuguese-Cuisine.htm" target="_blank">About Food</a>, Portuguese cuisine was highly influenced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors">Moors</a>, just like Spanish. And just like Spain they were also a major player in the exploration (first to sail the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 and established a route to the far east). This brought many new spices and ingredients to the portfolio of Portuguese chefs. Being a nation of explorers they also sailed West to South America and returned with pineapples, tomatoes, potatoes and corn which are all well established in the cuisine. The <a href="http://portuguesefood.about.com/od/PortHistory/a/The-Diverse-Influences-That-Created-Traditional-Portuguese-Cuisine.htm" target="_blank">article</a> also mentions strange combinations of ingredients such as bananas with fish. <br>Portuguese cuisine incorporates many properties of Mediterranean cuisine and seafood in general but according to our data Portuguese cuisine is mostly connected with central Europe its Mediterranean cousins landed on 8th (Spain) and 12th (Italy) place.</p> <br> <br><strong><h3>And finally the long expected Mexico:</h3></strong> <br> <br> <p id="explanation_intro">According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_cuisine">Mexican cuisine</a> is primarily a fusion of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European, especially Spanish, elements added after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century. African and Asian influences were also introduced into the mixture during this era as a result of African slavery and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_galleon">Manila-Acapulco Galleons</a>. This indicates a variety of influences from all over the place. Well it makes sense but according to our data Spain is ranked on 6th place, not nearly high enough. Top five are Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia and India respectively, all of them far away. <br> <br>One might wonder why we didn't include Mexico in the "little or no sense" section because the connection to these countries sure makes little (or no) sense. The most interesting part about Mexico is its position at the top 5 for some unusual cuisines, which are: Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, they are really a strange bunch. Mexico also appeared in top 5 for Spain but that makes perfect sense. <br>So let us dive deeper into our Mexican data: <br> <br>Number of recipes: <ins>2390</ins> <br>Number of ingredients: <ins>251</ins> <br>Number if ingredient categories: <ins>14</ins> <br> <br>Mexican cuisine in itself incorporates all ingredient categories from our dataset. It also includes 65 percents of all ingredients and in total represents 4 percent of total recipe mass. <br> <br>Next we checked the percentage of ingredients that are shared between Mexico and our strange crew of countries. We obtained the following results: <br> <br>-Bangladesh includes <ins>22</ins> ingredients of which <ins>21</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>95%.</ins> <br>-India includes <ins>205</ins> ingredients of which <ins>184</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>89%.</ins> <br>-Iran includes <ins>54</ins> ingredients of which <ins>50</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>92%.</ins> <br>-Pakistan includes <ins>51</ins> ingredients of which <ins>48</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>94%.</ins> <br>-Spain includes <ins>129</ins> ingredients of which <ins>124</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>96%.</ins> <br>-Turkey includes <ins>39</ins> ingredients of which <ins>39</ins> are mutual. That makes <ins>100%.</ins> <br> <br>Of course our similarities were calculated in a much more complex manner but the upper numbers indicate strong correlations between the countries and provide a possible explanation for the phenomena. <br> <br><strong>There is still something wrong with Mexico...</strong> <br> <br> </p> </div> <h1 id="to_about"><a href="about.html" target="_blank">DETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECT</a></h1> </div> </div> <div id="footer"> <div class="folder"> <div class="conectors_index"> <div class="git"> <a href="https://github.com/moserMatjaz" target="_blank"> <img src="github-icon.png" /> </a> </div> <div class="face"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matjaz.moser" target="_blank"> <img src="F_icon.png" /> </a> </div> <div class="linked"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matja%C5%BE-moser/88/410/b95" target="_blank"> <img src="Linked_in.png" /> </a> </div> <div class="mail_to"> <a href="sending.html" target="_blank"> <img src="gmail.png" /> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="head"> <h3 class="footer_text_header">General information:</h3> <p class="footer_text">Name: Matjaz Moser</p> <p class="footer_text">Email: matjaz.moser[at]gmail.com</p> <p class="footer_text">Address: Grenc 34, 4220 Skofja Loka, Slovenia</p> </div> </div></body></html>
